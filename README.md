# Set Theory Calculator

I made a calculator performs set operations on up to four sets (including the empty set) and outlines the steps involved. I also included a section on binary relations, where users can include or exclude ordered pairs from the relation and see how its properties change. This project is based on chapter two of _Natural Language Semantics: Formation and Valuation_ by Dr. Brendan Gillon. 

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.2. I use WebStorm as my IDE.

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
